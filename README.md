# ledger-api-go

> **Portfolio reconstruction** — a rebuild project created to demonstrate ledger/settlement engineering skills. This is not production code from any employer.

## Inspiration

The design borrows its posting semantics from a publicly described concept: **"idempotent fill settlement"** — the idea that re-submitting the same settlement must never book twice. Double-entry accounting is used here purely as this repo's own implementation pattern; no claim is made about any employer's systems.

## What this implements

- An in-memory double-entry ledger (`ledger` package) written with the Go standard library only.
- Money is represented as integer cents (`int64`); floating point is never used for amounts.
- Every journal entry touches exactly two accounts: the debit account's balance increases by the amount, the credit account's decreases by the same amount, so the sum of all balances is always zero.
- Entries are validated before booking: non-empty ID, distinct non-empty debit/credit accounts, and `amount_cents > 0`.
- Posting is idempotent: submitting an entry with a previously used `IdempotencyKey` returns the original entry and books nothing again. All state is guarded by a mutex and safe for concurrent use.
- A thin `net/http` JSON API exposes the ledger: no external dependencies.

## API

### `POST /entries`

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8080/entries \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"debit_account":"cash","credit_account":"equity","amount_cents":1000,"idempotency_key":"inv-001"}'
```

- First-time post → `201` with the entry JSON (the server generates `id` and `created_at`).
- Re-post with the same `idempotency_key` → `200` with the originally posted entry.
- Invalid entry (empty account, debit == credit, amount ≤ 0, malformed JSON) → `400` with an `{"error": ...}` body.

### `GET /accounts/{id}/balance`

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/accounts/cash/balance
# {"account":"cash","balance_cents":1000}
```

### `GET /accounts/{id}/snapshot`

Balance plus the ledger version at read time. The version bumps on every
successful post (idempotent replays and rejected entries don't count), so
two snapshots with the same version are guaranteed to show the same
balance — a cheap change detector for reconciliation jobs.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/accounts/cash/snapshot
# {"account":"cash","balance_cents":1000,"version":3}
```

### `GET /entries`

Time-windowed, cursor-paginated export of the journal, sorted by
`(CreatedAt, ID)`.

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:8080/entries?since=2026-10-01T00:00:00Z&limit=100'
# {"entries":[...],"next_cursor":"..."}   # empty next_cursor = last page
```

- `since` / `until`: RFC3339 timestamps filtering `CreatedAt` in
  `[since, until)`. Omitted `since` means the beginning of time; omitted
  `until` means no upper bound.
- `limit`: page size, defaults to 100, capped at 1000.
- `cursor`: opaque cursor from the previous response's `next_cursor`.
  Resumption is keyed on entry ID, so entries posted between two pages are
  never duplicated or skipped.
- Malformed timestamps, cursors, or limits → `400` with an `{"error": ...}` body.

## Running

Requires Go 1.27+.

```bash
go vet ./...
go test -race ./...
go run .                 # listens on :8080; override with PORT, e.g. PORT=9090 go run .
```

Environment:

- `PORT` — listen address (default `8080`).
- `LEDGER_IDEMPOTENCY_TTL` — how long idempotency keys are retained, e.g.
  `LEDGER_IDEMPOTENCY_TTL=72h`. Keys older than the TTL are evicted so the
  replay-detection index can't grow forever in a long-running process; the
  journal itself is append-only and never pruned. Pick a TTL longer than any
  client retry window. Unset means keys never expire.
